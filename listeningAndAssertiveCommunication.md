# Listening and Assertive Communication

## 1. What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)

- We should avoid getting distracted by our own thoughts and focus on the speaker.
- We should try not to interrupt the other person while they are speaking.
- We should use door openers. These are phrases, which shows our interest to the speaker.
- Show that we are listening using body language like a simple nod.
- If appropriate, we should take notes during important conversation.
- Paraphrase what the speaker has said, to know both of us are on the same page.

## 2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

- **Listen Actively**: Pay full attention to what the speaker is saying without interrupting or planning your response while they talk.  
- **Understand Emotions**: Try to grasp not just the words but also the feelings and emotions behind them.  
- **Paraphrase and Reflect**: Repeat back or summarize what the speaker said in your own words to confirm your understanding.  
- **Ask Clarifying Questions**: If something is unclear, ask questions to ensure you understand fully without making assumptions.

## 3. What are the obstacles in your listening process?

- Sometimes I get distracted by ideas that my mind comes up with about a topic during the conversation itself.

## 4. What can you do to improve your listening?

- **Focus Fully on the Speaker**: Avoid distractions and give your complete attention to the person speaking, both verbally and non-verbally.
- **Practice Active Listening**: Paraphrase, ask clarifying questions, and avoid interrupting to ensure you understand the message clearly.

## 5. When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

- **Avoiding Conflict**: We might want to keep the peace or avoid arguments in tense situations.  
- **Feeling Overwhelmed or Unsure**: We might feel uncertain or lack confidence in expressing your opinions or needs.  
- **Prioritizing Others**: We  prioritize someone else’s needs or feelings over your own to maintain harmony.

## 6. When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

- **Feeling Frustrated or Angry**: Emotions like frustration or anger take over, leading us to express ourselves forcefully.  
- **Desiring Control**: We feel the need to dominate a situation or impose our views on others.  
- **Reacting to Stress or Pressure**: High stress or feeling overwhelmed might cause us to communicate in an aggressive manner to vent or cope.  

## 7. When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

- **Avoiding Direct Confrontation**: We feel uncomfortable addressing issues directly but still want to express dissatisfaction or frustration.  
- **Feeling Resentful or Overlooked**: We believe our needs or opinions are being ignored and use sarcasm, taunts, or gossip as an outlet.  
- **Struggling to Express Emotions**: We find it difficult to openly communicate our feelings, resorting to behaviors like the silent treatment or indirect comments instead.
